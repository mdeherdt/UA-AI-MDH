## Bayesian Networks (BN)

## Q2: Exact Calculation

**Task:**  
Compute the exact probability of:  
 P(either=yes | xray=yes)

using the conditional probability tables from the appendix in the assignment.

**Show your work:**  
[Show your calculation step-by-step, or reference a PDF/image with your handwritten solution or solution on another program, e.g.:  
“See attached file `BN_Q2.pdf`.”]

**Exact Value:**  
P(either=yes | xray=yes) = [value]

**Comparison:**  
[Compare this value with your sampling result from Q1.]

## Q3: Exact with Extra Evidence

**Task:**  
Compute the exact probability  
P(either=yes | xray=yes, tub=yes).

**Derivation:**  
[Show or explain your work or reference a linked file.]

**Exact Value:**  
P(either=yes | xray=yes, tub=yes) = [value]

## Q4: D-Separation

**Task:**  
Determine whether each conditional independence statement holds in the Asia network.  
If it does not hold, list at least one active path.

| Statement                        | Independent? | Active Path (if any) |
|----------------------------------|--------------|----------------------|
| (a) asia ⟂ xray                  | [True/False] | [path if dependent] |
| (b) tub ⟂ smoke \| either        | [True/False] | [path if dependent] |
| (c) tub ⟂ bronc                  | [True/False] | [path if dependent] |
| (d) tub ⟂ bronc \| dysp          | [True/False] | [path if dependent] |
| (e) tub ⟂ bronc \| smoke, either | [True/False] | [path if dependent] |
